## Hi there! I'm Kylo and I'm a first-year at UChicago majoring in Human Rights and Computer Science!

### I'm excited to pursue an education that unites my passions for STEM and social justice. With over a decade of experience in technology and programming, my mission is to make computer science and other STEM fields more diverse and inclusive, particularly for POC and AFAB students.
